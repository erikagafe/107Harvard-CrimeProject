This is a document for providing background information that I have uploaded to the repository.

I. US Bureau of Justice
cv14.zip
From US Bureau of Justice report "Criminal Victimization in 2014". This seemed to be latest one to give high level national statistics about violent vst property crime. (http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=5366.)



II. Tables from the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) statistics table maker
http://www.ucrdatatool.gov/Search/Crime/Crime.cfm
These tables by state also include US total
A. All states and all types for 2012. Similar tables are possible for prior years on a year-by-year basis
UCR2012-crimebyusstate.csv

B. Historical table for one crime (this one for murder and non-negligent manslaughter). Similar tables for other crimes are possible.

Different formats of age/sex and household data for 2014.

ACS_14_5YR_DP05.xls - excel version
Similar formats available for a wide variety of conditions and regional breakdowns
